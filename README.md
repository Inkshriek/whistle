# Whistle

Whistle is a Metroidvania platform game, where rather than a slayer of monsters, you are a child looking to survive an abandoned underground city. All you have is your dagger, the clothes on your back, and a curious whistle for curious familiars. Though one may find there's much left behind here to discover. 

Just beware stepping into the light. After all, they can see you.

This is presently very early in development, so there isn't much to show just yet. We are prioritizing functionality for now, so look out for that!
